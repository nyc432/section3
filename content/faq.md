## If Donald J. Trump is an insurrectionist, why didn't Jack Smith charge him with that crime?
It's possible that Smith is considering it, especially if he's working towards persuading one or more of the currently unindicted co-conspirators to cooperate and provide evidence supporting such a charge.

When contemplating a charge of insurrection against Trump, Smith would certainly consider the fact that criminal charges demand proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This is a rigorous standard, set so high because society prioritizes preventing the wrongful conviction of innocent individuals.

In contrast, civil cases operate under the "preponderance of the evidence" standard. This means if there's more evidence suggesting Trump "engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the [Constitution], or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof," he could be deemed liable and barred from office.

This civil standard is distinct from the criminal charges currently facing Trump. The evidence threshold is lower in civil cases. Even if he's never convicted of a crime or is in fact unconvictable because of the required standard of proof, there remains the possibility that he could be prohibited from the Presidency under Section 3.
