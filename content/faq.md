## Why is this site not taking one side or the other?
There are arguments on both sides. There is simply not a clear answer. The only way this question can finally be decided, both for the present and for future possible cases, is for the Supreme Court to take it up. Their ruling will provide
guiding interpretations of the meaning of the specific phraseology in Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. 

After this, it will either be much easier to use to stop a candidacy, or much harder. But if there is no
serious attempt to apply it, which would inevitably end up in the Supreme Court, then it has no meaning
or value. And clearly, it was intended to have meaning and value.

## If Donald J. Trump is an insurrectionist, why didn't Jack Smith charge him with that crime?
It's possible that Smith is considering it, especially if he's working towards persuading one or more of the currently unindicted co-conspirators to cooperate and provide evidence supporting such a charge.

When contemplating a charge of insurrection against Trump, Smith would certainly consider the fact that criminal charges demand proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This is a rigorous standard, set so high because society prioritizes preventing the wrongful conviction of innocent individuals.

However, however invoking the 14th Amendment is not a criminal charge. And any lawsuits involved with keeping Trump off a ballot will be civil. For instance, here's [one discussion](https://thinkbigpicture.substack.com/p/trump-president-14th-amendment-disqualify) of the topic: 

> Plaintiffs, perhaps in separate cases across several states, will be seeking court declaration that Trump engaged in insurrection or rebellion or otherwise gave aid or comfort to the enemies of the U.S. through his actions, and inactions, around January 6. Importantly, these would not be criminal trials. Instead, they would be civil ones, which means the burden of proof would only be a preponderance of the evidence, or just over 50 percent. 

So, even if he's never convicted of a crime, or is in fact unconvictable because of the required standard of proof, there remains the strong possibility that should be prohibited from the Presidency under the 14th Amendment.
