## If Donald J. Trump is an insurrectionist, why didn't Jack Smith charge him with that crime?
It's possible that Smith is considering it, especially if he's working towards persuading one or more of the currently unindicted co-conspirators to cooperate and provide evidence supporting such a charge.

When contemplating a charge of insurrection against Trump, Smith would certainly consider the fact that criminal charges demand proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This is a rigorous standard, set so high because society prioritizes preventing the wrongful conviction of innocent individuals.

In contrast, civil cases operate under the "preponderance of the evidence" standard. And [that's what a 14th Amendment case against Mr. Trump would be](https://thinkbigpicture.substack.com/p/trump-president-14th-amendment-disqualify). This standard says that you need just over 50% of the evidence to say that Trump is an insurrectionist and the ruling would be that he is barred.

So, even if he's never convicted of a crime, or is in fact unconvictable because of the required standard of proof, there remains the possibility that he could be prohibited from the Presidency under the 14th Amendment.
