This lawsuit didn't seem serious enough to mention in the initial post, but a tax consultant named John Anthony Castro filed a [lawsuit](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23840274-castro-v-trump-lawsuit) under the 14th Amendment in Texas to get Mr. Trump taken off the ballot.

It's mentioned now because the Supreme Court has [declined to hear the case](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/supreme-court-quashes-2024-long-shot-candidates-14th-amendment-case-against-trump/ar-AA1hAei6):

> A federal judge dismissed Castro's lawsuit in June, finding that he couldn't show legal injury, which prompted him to appeal to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.
